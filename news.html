                        <p class="someText">
                            The count of confirmed exoplanets just ticked past the 5,000 mark, representing a 30-year journey of discovery led by NASA space telescopes.Not so long ago, we lived in a universe with only a small number of known planets, all of them orbiting our Sun. But a new raft of discoveries marks a scientific high point: More than 5,000 planets are now confirmed to exist beyond our solar system.The 5,000-plus planets found so far include small, rocky worlds like Earth, gas giants many times larger than Jupiter, and “hot Jupiters” in scorchingly close orbits around their stars. There are “super-Earths,” which are possible rocky worlds bigger than our own, and “mini-Neptunes,” smaller versions of our system’s Neptune. Add to the mix planets orbiting two stars at once and planets stubbornly orbiting the collapsed remnants of dead stars.

                        <h2>New Planet Discovered Orbiting Proxima Centauri, the Star Closest to Our Own Sun</h2>
                        <p class="someText">
                            A team of astronomers has discovered a new planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the star closest to the Sun. The candidate planet, named Proxima d, is the third detected in the system and it is among the lightest of the exoplanets discovered so far. Proxima d is only a quarter of the mass of Earth and orbits extremely close to its parent star, at one-tenth of the distance between the Sun and the Solar System's innermost planet, Mercury. So, the alien world is just short of the distance Proxima Centauri is from our solar system: about four light-years away.The astronomers used the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT) in Chile to spot this exoplanet. The planet orbits Proxima Centauri at a distance of about four million kilometres. But it is not quite welcoming. It orbits between the star and the habitable area, too close to have liquid water. Observations also showed that it completes a full orbit of the star every five days on Earth.
